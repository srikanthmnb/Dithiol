# Dithiol
I worked on this project during my PhD at Iowa State University under the supervision of Dr. Mallapragada. 
We explored the possibilty of chaining nanoparticles together into assemblies using bifucntional ligands. In this case, we leveraged the gold-thiol interaction and used dithiolated oligomers of ethylene glycol. The codes shared here were used to fit the smal-angle X-ray scattering patterns of the short-ranged order observed in the assemblies of nanoparticles obtained with the dithiol linkers. 

Pulsihed results of this study can be seen here.
